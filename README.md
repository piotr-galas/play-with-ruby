Play with ruby
==============


In this repository i will put my play with pure ruby.
Every folder is separated application, or set of classes not related to rest of logic in this repository

e.g in arrays i just invoke all available methods from array class
in Rack i created few rack application


In every folder or file is description  what this folder is.
It is dedicated for my private use, and every comments are adds for me to understand in future.
But if it can be help for somebody it would be nice.
